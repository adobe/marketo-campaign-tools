# Adobe Marketo Campaign Tools

This tool is design to assist and facilitate Marketo customers with the creation campaign URLs. In order to most effectively utilize this tool, Marketo customers will need to understand the following primary concepts: 

  1. Campaigns
  1. Dimensions

## Campaigns

A campaign is an organized and concerted effort to drive towards a particular goal. The key words being "organized," "concerted," and, "particular goal." The act of informing your customers about a new product (marketing) and facilitating a transaction (commerce) does not alone qualify as a campaign. We can make this a campaign by adding clarity in goal and operation: sell 200,000 units in North America of this new product within the first fiscal quarter of availabilty via our new product website.

Once you've identified a campaign, it's time to break that down into the various components that will be needed in order to effectively track the overall efficacy of the campaigns tactics.

## Dimensions

Dimensions should help to categorize content in a manner that is exclusive to other dimensions. For instance, common dimensions in a campaign could include the following: 

  - Region
  - Channel (or Campaign Type)
  - Season
  - Affiliate ID

While dimensions could have similar associated values (e.g. a numerical ID code for the various dimensions could result in several "1" values), the combination of the dimension and the value make that data uniquely different from other dimensional values, thus allowing for categorization and analysis. 

If we take our example campaign, we might identify the following dimensions: 

  - Region (North America)
  - SKU (the specific product we're selling)
  - Quarter (the fiscal quarter in-which the product is sold)
  - Channel (website vs. in-store and partner-site purchases)
